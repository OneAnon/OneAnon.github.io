Hello, this is a stale site I created for random things, experiments and more! 

Here, I'd like to explore, and experiment with things sometimes trivial and extreme!

Occasionally there may be partner links within.

Thank you for stopping in! Drop a follow on my socials if you use any of this code! Thanks
